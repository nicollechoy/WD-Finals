### Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
Welcome to my personal website! This project showcases my work and coursework from the Web Development with Client-Side Scripting class, highlighting what I’ve learned. It features five different pages with unique designs and interactive buttons that are fun and easy to use. My skills in HTML, CSS, and layout helped me create a user-friendly site that shows off my design and web development abilities.

The goal of this portfolio is to apply what I’ve learned in a practical and creative way. It serves as a professional tool to highlight my skills, past projects, and creativity while demonstrating my web design and development capabilities. This website acts as a digital resume and a way to share my skills with potential employers or clients.

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.
